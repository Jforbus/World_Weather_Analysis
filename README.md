## Project Overview

This project collects weather data using OpenWeather's Current Weather API, filters this data based on temperature criteria input by the customer, then suggests vacation destinations based on the temperature preferences using GMaps. Once location selections have been made, GMaps Directions is utilized to create a travel route through the selected cities and return this itinerary to the customer.
